This paper presents an improved genetic algorithm to solve the distributed generation (DG) allocation problem in radial electrical distribution systems. The problem is formulated as a non-linear mixed integer, the  integer variables indicate the position where the DG will be allocated and the continuous variables, associated with electrical values (voltage, current, active and reactive power losses and power flow). In the proposed formulation, different load levels are considered to obtain more realistic results. The objective is to minimize costs produced by system losses, maintenance and implementation of the DG. The proposed methodology has been successfully tested for distribution systems with 69 and 135 buses.
